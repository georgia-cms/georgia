Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you overwrite default options in your georgia initializer.
     Find me at config/initializers/georgia.rb

  2. Ensure your routes we've just added are in order.

  3. Run foreman to start solr whenever you start your rails server.

       bundle exec foreman start
